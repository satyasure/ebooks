# 10 effective yoga asanas for tuberculosis patients
 
## Bhastrika
Let’s start with the bhastrika, a popular yoga exercise for TB patients and the easiest. While to an onlooker, all the one gets to do here is sit and know there is more to it. In English, you call it below breathing, and this is exactly what the pose is about and what you do when in it.
 
The pose is known to strengthen the liver, the kidneys and the body’s overall immunity, getting rid of all aches and pains as it removes all toxins and rejuvenates the body. This means that apart from recovering your health after TB, you will also look young and healthy with glowing skin.
 
## Naukasana
This is mainly a yoga pose that, when practised, gives the doer the form of a boat. In other words, you pose like you’re a boat. Doing the naukasana for a couple of minutes a day can greatly build the capacity of the lungs, liver and pancreas, thus maintaining the body’s blood sugar levels.
 
However, patients with asthma, migraines, high blood pressure, other cardiac complaints and even spinal and chronic complaints should refrain from this pose.
 
## Trikonasana
If the boat pose makes you look like a boat, the trikonasana makes you look like a triangle. You perform the pose while standing here, but don’t be fooled. The pose is a hard one to master and will need lots of practice. Yet, it can greatly serve as a stress buster apart from strengthening the immunity of your liver along with your arms, legs and chest.
 
So, overall, this is one pose that can maintain both the body’s physical as well as mental equilibrium, so why not go ahead and try it?
 
## Tadasana
Ah, now this yoga exercise for TB patients is easy; all you must do is stand like a mountain. Yet, it will require some dedication as the lack of challenge in this pose can soon get you bored.
 
But make sure you don’t give up, as this yoga pose can greatly strengthen the lungs and the respiratory system while relieving tension and pain.
 
## Uttanpadasana
Ok, now this can be challenging, and you must first take the floor and raise your legs.
 
A lot of coughing often accompanies tuberculosis, and this is a great solution to it.
 
What’s more, it is also known to strengthen the kidneys and the spine, often affecting patients with tuberculosis.
 
## Ustrasana
Now, this is a difficult one, but the challenge is what makes it fun. Here, you pose to look like a camel, which can be hard at first but don’t worry, for with the right guidance, you will soon be able to master it.
 
If you are suffering from bronchitis or asthma, try the ustrasana. The intense back bending that is involved in this is known to be of great help to individuals suffering from any of these.
 
## Kanasana
If trikonasana is too hard for you, you could start with the kanasana, which translates to the angle pose and gives you only half the challenge of the trikonasana.
 
Nevertheless, the benefits are many, starting with the respiratory organs and then going on to include the shoulder, spine and, to some extent, the heart.
 
In all, this pose, though simple, is greatly known to revitalise the entire system and make you more immune.
 
## Mandukasana
Have you ever tried sitting like a frog? Well, maybe it’s time to do it now that you’re on rest and need something to kill time with.
 
This calls for a few minutes of mandukasana each day to increase your lung capacity and also help you recover from tuberculosis.
 
## Bhujangasana
This is one yoga pose that is effective by way of opening the chest, which is why it is known to help patients suffering from tuberculosis.
 
What it mainly does is to clear the lungs and the heart to bring about better blood flow to the muscles.
 
This can also release fatigue, stress and body sickness, making you relaxed and flexible.
 
## Kapalbhati
Ok, we wouldn’t recommend this yoga exercise for those suffering from viral infections or serious aches and pains, preferably those in the neck and spine. Also, refrain from it if you are pregnant or going through your menstrual cycle. And this is why we put the kapalbati last on this yoga for TB patients list. Yet, if you still think you are capable of it, it is at your own risk.
